## Pseudo class vs Pseudo element <a name="pseudo"></a>
- Basically a pseudo-class is a selector that assists in the selection of something that cannot be expressed by a simple selector, for example :hover. A pseudo-element however allows us to create items that do not normally exist in the document tree, for example ```::after```.<br />
- Pseudo-classes select regular elements but under certain conditions, like when their position relative to siblings or when theyâ€™re under a particular state.<br />
- Pseudo-elements effectively create new elements that are not specified in the markup of the document and can be manipulated much like a regular element. This introduces huge benefits for creating cool effects with minimal markup, also aiding significantly in keeping the presentation of the document out of the HTML and in CSS where it belongs.<br />
